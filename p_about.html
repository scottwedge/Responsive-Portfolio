                        You may think I'm Shane Koehler, but you're wrong.  I am a man with no name.  
                        You see my picture to the left?  Is it woman?  Is it man?  It does not matter for this person is no one.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This no one may care who you are or where you come from.  They may not sleep, as sleep is for the fallen.  
                        They may end you with a single flick of the wrist, through an angry brow or a weeping sadness.  
                        It does not matter.  We are no one, you cannot judge the likes of no one as the Many-Faced God does.  
                        We execute your fate as He commands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Who is He?  You dare not ask for he is after us all.  Seek him and give a name and you shall drink from the fountain.  
                        The fountain shall do many-faced things that one can only find through a name given.  Confused? 
                        Fear not!  For the Many-Faced God is no one, too.
